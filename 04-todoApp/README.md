# Todo App in Angular 2 with Typescript via Automated Workflow

## Important Notes

    Seed taken from Hello World - 03 example and build Todo App on top of it.

    First thing we created Todo Class which represent our Todo as Model in todo.ts located at todo component folder.

    In angular 2 either we will have component or class which can be used as service.

    Second we created Todo Component which represent View & Controller for single Todo.

    Last but not least we created Todos Component which is going to represent our collection of Todos.

    In Todo Component we are using Inputs to get data from Todos Component (where Collection stores) and Outputs to send back events via Event Emitter.
